# The Dylaila Mean Seed

A simple MEAN seed I use with a very organized structure I like. This project would not have been possible without Naila Nur, who contributed gratly to its success and its name.

## How to use this Project

You can add all of your routes to route.js in the App directory. This is where server-side routing is done.
The main server file is the top-level directory server.js - it includes a setup for a mongo database.

It then becomes as simple as building a regular Angular project from the public directory.

## Future Versions

If you have suggestions to improve this project or would like to make some contribution I encourage you to fork the repo and I will view any and all merge requests.

In particular, the documentation on this project could be greatly improved. But it is exam season right now, so I'll have to do it later.
